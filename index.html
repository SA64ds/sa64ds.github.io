         <p>I'm just a dude that likes Mario games, nothing special.</p>

         <h1>Facts about me</h1>
         <ul>
            <li>I live in the United States in the Eastern Standard Timezone.
            <li>My birth date is June 30th, 2005 (fun fact: that's exactly a year before New Super Mario Bros. was released in Europe)
            <li>I'm currently in college (not saying where for privacy reasons)
            <li>I'm autistic and might have ADHD, so be aware of that when talking to me.
            <li>I'm a straight male (he/him pronouns)
            <li>I'm currently single (not that I'm searching for a date rn, but thought I should mention that).
            <li>I like to play video games. My favorite video game franchise is Super Mario if you somehow can't tell.
            <li>I like retro video game aesthetics, such as pixel and low-poly. Kinda obvious if you look at this site
            <li>My sona is literally just Mario, but with a blue hoodie and shoes, red pants, and no hat. Makes him easy to draw at least.
         </ul>
         <h1>What I can do as a creative</h1>
         <ul>
            <li>I stream on YouTube and Twitch sometimes
            <li>I like to make pixel art, particularly with the limitations of the NES or Game Boy Color.
            <li>I make charts for Friday Night Funkin' mods. I also do basic covers of songs.
            <li>I sometimes make basic models for the Customizable Player Models mod for Minecraft (Java Edition).
         </ul>

            <h1>My policy with talking to minors</h1>
            <p>First and foremost, I'm over the age of 18 and do not support any form of grooming minors! If we've already talked before and are good friends, then it's fine to talk in private. Otherwise, keep any discussions either brief or in a group setting. In general, if I ever make you uncomfortable or upset, just tell me and I'll try to stop.</p>
