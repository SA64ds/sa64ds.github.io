      <p>Hello! Welcome to the rules of SA64 page. This is for rules about how I operate on the internet that I will try to follow. I know there are things that I have to speak about that not everyone wants to hear, so I felt it warranted a seperate page.</p>

      <h1>Swearing</h1>
      <p>I don't swear directly, but I might use pseudonyms for swearing so I can say I don't swear. Doesn't mean a swear couldn't escape accidentally.</p>
      <h1>Using Slurs</h1>
      <p>No, I'll never do that. I'll die before I use a slur ever.</p>
      <h1>Interacting with minors</h1>
      <p>First and foremost, I do not support any form of grooming minors! It is an awful thing that I don't want to do to others.</p>
      <p>Generally, if we've already talked before and are good friends, then I'll consider it fine to talk in private. Otherwise, keep any discussions either brief or in a group setting.</p>
      <p>In general, if I ever make you uncomfortable or upset, just tell me and I'll try to stop.</p>
      <h1>Interacting with NSFW content</h1>
      <p>I try to not to interact with content of that nature because it's something I don't want to associate with.</p>
      <p>I say try because occasionally there are NSFW creators on Bluesky that don't mark their media as Adult Content, probably because Twitter doesn't have a toggle for Adult Content like BSky, so it shows up in Feeds I follow even if I have Adult Content disabled, so I have to report the content for the poster not marking the post correctly.</p>
      <p>If you don't believe me, here is my Bluesky Content Filter that I've never changed since creating my account (although, I can't really prove that, can I?).</p>
